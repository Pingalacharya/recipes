    "**iterator** is a more general concept: any object whose class has a `__next__` method  and an `__iter__` method that does return self. Every generator is an iterator, **specifically, generator is a subtype of iterator**. A generator is built by calling a function that has one or more yield expressions.\n",

    "**Generators provide an easy, built-in way to create instances of Iterators. A function with yield in it, when called, returns an instance of a generator object**\n",
    "\n",

    "1. When a generator function is called, it returns an generator object without even beginning the execution of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the `next()` method is called for the first time, the function starts executing until it reaches a yield statement which returns the yielded value. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The yield keeps track of what has happened, i.e. it remembers the last execution. And secondly, the next() call continues from the previous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to use a custom iterator, rather than a generator, **when you need a class with somewhat complex state-maintaining behavior, or want to expose other methods besides `__next__` and `__iter__` and `__init__`.** \n",

    "*If you create your own iterator, it is a little bit involved - you have to create a class and at least implement the iter and the next methods. But what if you don't want to go through this hassle and want to quickly create an iterator. Fortunately, Python provides a short-cut way to defining an iterator. All you need to do is define a function with at least 1 call to yield and now when you call that function it will return \"something\" which will act like an iterator (you can call next method and use it in a for loop). This something has a name in Python called Generator*"

    "Previous answers missed this addition: a generator has a close method, while typical iterators don’t. The close method triggers a StopIteration exception in the generator, which may be caught in a finally clause in that iterator, to get a chance to run some clean‑up. This abstraction makes it most usable in the large than simple iterators. One can close a generator as one could close a file, without having to bother about what’s underneath.\n",
